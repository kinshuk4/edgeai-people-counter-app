## Project Set-Up - Classroom Workspace

We have provided a CPU classroom workspace, set up with the Intel® Distribution of the OpenVINO™ Toolkit, along with all necessary dependencies installed, later in this lesson. No additional set-up is required in the workspace. However, if you would like to work on your local machine, we have also provided additional local set-up instructions below.
